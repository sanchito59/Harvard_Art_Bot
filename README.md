Harvard Art Bot is a Twitter bot built with Node.js and the Twitter API and ES6 promises. The goal of the project was to explore using the file system utilities to download an image given a url and tweet that image. The bot pings the [Harvard Art Museum API](https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs), grabs a random record based on the page count and records per page, and creates a caption to tweet with the image. It is hosted on Heroku using scheduled dynamos to run.
